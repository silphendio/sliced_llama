# sliced_llama
Simple LLM inference server using [exllamav2](https://github.com/turboderp/exllamav2)

## Features
- partly OpenAI-compatible API (this is a work in progress)
- Layer Slicing: Basically instant Franken-self-merges. You don't even need to reload the model (just the cache).
- Top Logprobs: See the top probabilities for each chosen token. This might help with adjusting sampler parameters.
- Text Completion WebUI

## Installation
- Make sure python and CUDA or RocM (Linux only) is installed.
- Clone or download this repository.
- Use the setup script. This creates a venv and installs dependencies.
```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/silphendio/sliced_llama
cd sliced_llama
python ./setup.py
```

DISCLAIMER: I haven't tested it on windows at all.

## Usage
On Linux, just run it with
```bash
./sliced_llama_server.py
```
On Windows, click `start.bat` instead. (It invokes `.venv\Scripts\python sliced_llama_server.py`)

This starts the inference server and the webUI. There, you can load models, adjust parameters and do inference.
You can also use command line arguments, e.g.:
```
./sliced_llama_server.py --model ~/path/to/llm-model-exl2/ --context-size 2048 --slices "0-24, 8-32"
```
Currently only exl2 models are supported. You can get them from [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/models?sort=trending&search=exl2).
Make sure that the model fits into VRAM, with some extra memory depending on `(context size)Â² * (number of layers)`, where context size is the number of tokens the model can remember.

The WebUI currently only supports text completion, so you need to do the prompt formatting yourself. Each model has its preferred prompt format, so look it up.

## WebUI Screenshot
Light / Dark mode depends on system / browser settings

## Compatibility with other apps:
As an alternative to the webUI, the server can also connect to OpenAI-compatible GUIs like [Mikupad](https://github.com/lmg-anon/mikupad) or [SillyTavern](https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern).


- For SillyTavern, select chat completion, and use `http://127.0.0.1:57593/v1` as costum endpoint.
  This will not give you many options, but if you change parameters in the WebUI, the inference server should remember them.
  You can select different chat templates in the WebUI. You can add more to the `chat_templates` folder.

## TODO / missing features
In no particular order:
- configuration file
- LoRA support
- Classifier Free Guidance
- OpenAI API:
  - chat completion currently only works with streaming
  - `presency_penalty` and `frequency_penalty` aren't supported
  - authentication
  - usage statistics
- compatibility with TabbyAPI (For better SillyTavern integration)
- merging different models together
- different merging methods
