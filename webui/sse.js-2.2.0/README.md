# sse.js

`sse.js` is a flexible `EventSource` replacement for JavaScript designed
to consume Server-Sent Events (SSE) streams with more control and
options than the standard `EventSource`. The main limitations of
`EventSource` are that it only supports no-payload GET requests, and
does not support specifying additional custom headers to the HTTP
request.

This package is designed to provide a usable replacement to
`EventSource` that makes all of this possible: `SSE`. It is a fully
compatible `EventSource` polyfill so you should be able to do this if
you want/need to:

```js
EventSource = SSE;
```

## Constructor

```js
var source = new SSE(url, options);
```

## Usage

The most simple way to use `SSE` is to create the `SSE` object, attach
one or more listeners, and activate the stream:

```js
var source = new SSE(url);
source.addEventListener('message', function(e) {
  // Assuming we receive JSON-encoded data payloads:
  var payload = JSON.parse(e.data);
  console.log(payload);
});
```

Like `EventSource`, `SSE` will automatically execute the request and
start streaming. If you want to disable this behavior, and be more
specific as to when the request should be triggered, you can pass
the `start: false` option and later call the `stream()` method:

```js
var source = new SSE(url, {start: false});
source.addEventListener('message', (e) => { ... });
// ... later on
source.stream();
```

### Passing custom headers

```js
var source = new SSE(url, {headers: {'Authorization': 'Bearer 0xdeadbeef'}});
```

### Making a POST request and overriding the HTTP method

To make a HTTP POST request, simply specify a `payload` in the options:

```js
var source = new SSE(url, {headers: {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'},
                           payload: 'Hello, world!'});
```

Alternatively, you can also manually override the HTTP method used to
perform the request, regardless of the presence of a `payload` option, by
specifying the `method` option:

```js
var source = new SSE(url, {headers: {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'},
                           payload: 'Hello, world!',
                           method: 'GET'});
```

### Options reference

| Name              | Description |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| `headers`         | A map of additional headers to use on the HTTP request |
| `method`          | Override HTTP method (defaults to `GET`, unless a payload is given, in which case it defaults to `POST`) |
| `payload`         | An optional request payload to sent with the request |
| `withCredentials` | If set to `true`, CORS requests will be set to include credentials |
| `start`           | Automatically execute the request and start streaming (defaults to `true`) |
| `debug`           | Log debug messages to the console about received chunks and dispatched events (defaults to `false`) |

## Events

`SSE` implements the `EventTarget` interface (just like `EventSource`)
and emits fully constructed `Event` objects. The type of the event
corresponds to the Server-Sent Event's _name_, and the event's timestamp
is the UNIX timestamp of the _reception_ of the event.

Additionally, the events will have the following fields:

- `id`: the event ID, if present; `null` otherwise
- `data`: the event data, unparsed

`SSE`, like `EventSource`, will emit the following events:

- `open`, when the first block of data is received from the event
  stream;
- `error`, if an error occurs while making the request;
- `abort`, as a response to the stream being explicitely aborted by the
  client;
- `readystatechange`, to notify of a change in the ready state of the
  event source.

Note that all events dispatched by `SSE` will have the event target
initially set to the `SSE` object itself.

## Listening for specific event types

The [Server-Sent Events
specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/comms.html#server-sent-events)
allows for arbitrary event types, as the `event` field of the event. The
default event type is `message`, so you'll most likely want to register
a listener for this kind of events. If you expect another type of
events, simply register your callback with the appropriate event type:

```js
var source = new SSE(url);
source.addEventListener('status', function(e) {
  console.log('System status is now: ' + e.data);
});
source.stream();
```

You can also register an event listener with the `on<event>` style:

```js
var source = new SSE(url);
source.onstatus = function(e) { ... };
```

You can mix both `on<event>` and `addEventListener()`. The `on<event>`
handler is always called first if it is defined.


## Expected response from server

It is expected that the server will return the data in the following
format, as defined [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events):

```
event: <type>\n
data: <data>\n
\n
```

## `withCredentials` support

This `EventSource` polyfill supports the `withCredentials` option to
request that the outgoing HTTP request be made with a CORS credentials
mode of `include`, as per the [HTML Living
Standard](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-credentials-mode).

## TODOs and caveats

- Internet Explorer 11 does not support arbitrary values in
  `CustomEvent`s.  A dependency on `custom-event-polyfill` is necessary
  for IE11 compatibility.
- Improve `XmlHttpRequest` error handling and connection states
- Automatically reconnect with `Last-Event-ID`
